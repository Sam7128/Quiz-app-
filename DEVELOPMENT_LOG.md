# Development Log

## 2026-02-04 [v0.3.0]
### ✨ New Features
- **Game Mode (RPG Battle Arena)**:
  - Implemented global `gameMode` toggle in `Settings.tsx` with persistence.
  - Developed `BattleArena` component with "Underground" theme (Dark mode optimized).
  - Added "Stage Transition" full-screen animation when clearing levels.
  - Integrated battle logic into `QuizCard` with global state management.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes & Refactoring
- **Accessibility (A11y)**:
  - Added `aria-label` to all icon-only buttons in `Settings.tsx` and `App.tsx` [Fixes "Buttons must have discernible text"].
  - Added `aria-label` to select elements [Fixes "Select element must have an accessible name"].
- **Code Quality**:
  - Removed duplicate `onAnswer` and `onNext` props in `App.tsx` [Fixes "JSX duplicate properties"].
  - Refactored `QuizCard.tsx` to remove redundant local state (`battleMode`) in favor of global props.
  - Fixed lint errors for redeclared variables in `BattleArena.tsx`.

### 📝 Documentation
- Updated `CHECKLIST.md` marking Game Mode as complete.
- Updated `GEMINI.md` with recent changes.

## 2026-02-05 [v0.3.1]

### ✨ New Features

## 2026-02-05 [v0.3.2]
### ✨ New Features
- **Data Management (Root Out)**:
  - **Batch Delete**: Implemented multi-bank deletion in `Dashboard.tsx` via checkbox selection.
  - **System Nuke**: Added "Danger Zone" in `Settings.tsx` to wipe all local data and configurations.
  - **Enhanced Reset Protocol**: Modified nuke logic to forcefully sign out from Supabase and clear all `localStorage` keys with prefix `mindspark_` to ensure total cleanup.
  - **Sample Data**: Created `multiple_choice_sample.json` for testing multiple-choice imports.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Console Optimization**:
  - Replaced Supabase `.single()` with `.limit(1)` in analytics and streak services. This eliminates noisy "406 Not Acceptable" log errors when no rows are found, improving developer experience and console purity.
- **Naming Alignment**:
  - Renamed `lich_king.png` to `skeleton_wizard.png` to match updated monster data and prevent asset potential 404s.
