# MindSpark AI Study Assistant - Project Context

## 0. Critical Protocols (鐵規)
*   **Protocol: CHECKLIST_FIRST**: Must maintain and update `CHECKLIST.md` for every major task.
*   **Protocol: LANGUAGE_ZH_TW**: All interactions and responses MUST be in Traditional Chinese (繁體中文).

## 1. Project Overview

**MindSpark** is a React-based Single Page Application (SPA) designed to be an AI-powered study companion. It acts as a client-side interface for managing and practicing with question banks generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) like Gemini, ChatGPT, or Claude.

*   **Type:** Frontend Web Application (React + Vite + TypeScript).
*   **Core Philosophy:** "Human-in-the-loop" AI integration. The app does not call AI APIs directly (currently); instead, it provides optimized prompts for users to generate content externally and import it as structured JSON.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (inferred from utility classes).
*   **Icons:** `lucide-react`.

## 2. Architecture & Design Patterns

### 2.1 State Management & Persistence
The application uses a **Serverless/Local-First** architecture.
*   **Database:** `localStorage` is used as the primary data store.
*   **Persistence Layer:** `services/storage.ts` encapsulates all storage logic. Direct `localStorage` calls should be avoided in components.
    *   **Banks Metadata:** `mindspark_banks_meta` (List of banks).
    *   **Bank Data:** `mindspark_bank_{UUID}` (Questions for a specific bank).
    *   **Mistake Log:** `mindspark_mistake_log` (Global tracking of wrong answers).
*   **Component State:** React `useState` and `useEffect` manage the runtime session (quiz progress, active view).

### 2.2 Routing
*   **Custom View Router:** The app does *not* use `react-router`. Navigation is handled via a `view` state in `App.tsx` (`dashboard` | `quiz` | `mistakes` | `manager` | `guide`).

### 2.3 AI Workflow
1.  **Prompting:** User goes to "AI 指引" (`AIPromptGuide.tsx`) to copy a structured prompt.
2.  **Generation:** User generates questions in an external LLM (Gemini/ChatGPT).
3.  **Import:** User pastes the JSON output into "題庫管理" (`BankManager.tsx`).
4.  **Practice:** Questions are stored locally and available for quizzes.

## 3. Key Data Structures (`types.ts`)

*   **`Question`:** The core unit. Supports `single` and `multiple` choice. Includes `hint` and `explanation`.
*   **`BankMetadata`:** Light interface for listing banks (ID, name, count) without loading full datasets.
*   **`MistakeLog`:** Tracks question IDs that were answered incorrectly, enabling "Mistake Review Mode".

## 4. Development & Commands

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js (v18+ recommended)

### Scripts (`package.json`)
*   `npm install`: Install dependencies.
*   `npm run dev`: Start the local development server (Vite).
*   `npm run build`: Build for production (`dist/` folder).
*   `npm run preview`: Preview the production build.

## 5. Directory Structure
*   `App.tsx`: Main entry point, layout, and routing logic.
*   `components/`: UI Components.
    *   `Dashboard.tsx`: Home screen, bank selection.
    *   `QuizCard.tsx`: The actual quiz interface.
    *   `BankManager.tsx`: CRUD for banks and JSON import/export logic.
    *   `AIPromptGuide.tsx`: Dynamic AI Prompt Builder with configurable options (type, language).
*   `services/`: Business logic.
    *   `storage.ts`: The "backend" (CRUD operations for localStorage).
*   `types.ts`: TypeScript definitions (Schema).
*   `constants.ts`: Global constants (Default questions, App Name).

## 6. Important Notes for Context7/Gemini
*   **No Backend API:** Do not assume existence of a `/api` endpoint. All data is local.
*   **JSON Strictness:** The `BankManager` implies strict JSON structure for imports. When debugging import issues, check `BankManager.tsx`'s validation logic.
*   **Tailwind:** Use Tailwind classes for styling changes.

## 7. Recent Changes (v0.1.1)
*   **Dashboard:** Removed the 20-question limit for quizzes.
*   **AIPromptGuide:** Upgraded to a dynamic form allowing users to customize question types (single/mixed/multiple) and output languages.
